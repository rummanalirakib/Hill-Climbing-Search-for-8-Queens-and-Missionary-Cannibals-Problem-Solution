# Problem 1
Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of a river, along with a boat that can hold one or two people. Find a way to get everyone to the other side without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place. This problem is famous in AI because it was the subject of the first paper that approached problem formulation from an analytical viewpoint.

1. Implement and solve the problem using a BFS, DFS. Coding required. After you are done with this question, please record your computer screen with audio to show the code, run your code, and explain your solution.
2. Design a heuristic function for this question and explain your design.2 Then implement and solve the problem using the greedy best-first search and the A* search algorithm. Coding required. After you are done with this question, please record your computer screen with audio to show the code, run your code, and explain your solution.

# Problem 2
In the textbook, (Hill-climbing search), when describing hill-climbing search algorithm, it says
Starting from a randomly generated 8-queens state, steepest- ascent hill climbing gets stuck 86% of the time, solving only 14% of problem instances. On the other hand, it works quickly, taking just 4 steps on average when it succeeds and 3 when it gets stuck—not bad for a state space with 88 ≈ 17 million states.
1. Implement steepest-ascent hill climbing for the 8-queens problem, run it 1000 times, record the steps taken in each run, then calculate on av- erage your implement takes how many steps when it succeeds, and how many steps when it fails. Also calculate among the 1000 runs, how many times it succeeds to find a solution and how many times if fails to find a solution.
please record your computer screen with audio to show the code, run your code, and explain your solution.

The same section later says, that with sideways move 3, “...This raises the percentage of problem instances solved by hill climbing from 14% to 94%. Success comes at a cost: the algorithm averages roughly 21 steps for each successful instance and 64 for each failure”
2 Implement steepest-ascent hill climbing with sideways move , for the 8-queens problem, run it 1000 times, record the failure/success rate; record the steps taken in each run, then calculate on average your implement takes how many steps when it succeeds, and how many steps when it fails.
Please record your computer screen with audio to show the code, run your code, and explain your solution.
